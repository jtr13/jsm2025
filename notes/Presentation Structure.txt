Presentation Structure

Section 1: Introduction
- ggplot2
- grammar of graphics - concept of layering and in grammar
- introduce two tier classification system, by construct/grammar as previously discussed and by purpose/topic

Section 2: Classification by construct
- Subsection 1: ggplot2 grammar
- Give example code block for each: packages for new geoms, new scales, new stats, new facet, new themes
- Subsection 2: alternative initialize plot function
- Give example code block for each: transforms data, does not return ggplot2 object, new components (maintains layering system)

Section 3: Classification by purpose/topic
- Specialized full plots
- Statistical functions
- Biology
- Labels/text
- Plot positioning
- Interactivity
